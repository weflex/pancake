# PancakeD Specfication

This is a Working Draft of the Specification for Pancake Document, a table-based document format
created by WeFlex for describing how to define your data models.

## Getting Started

PancakeD is mostly for developing a model system for the Node.js platform, so it of course contains
the ECMAScript's built-in types as:

- Number
- String
- Object
- Boolean

Otherwise, PancakeD also defines a way to create meta type which you can use it in your model
definitions.
